<footer>Presenter note for the first slide</footer>

## Heading

In your slides text you can use [links](http://google.com/) and various inline elements for _emotional_ and **strong** emphasis or just for <i>italic</i> or <b>bold</b> decoration. `<code>` is used for inline code samples.

<footer>Presenter note for the second slide</footer>

## Two rows.<br> Mighty heading

You can use two lines header but it would reduce space on a slide. The “Ribbon” theme is designed for seven lines of code after one-line header by default.

## Various lists

- Simple lists are marked with bullets.
- Ordered lists begin with a number.
- You can even nest lists one inside another.
    1. Or mix their types.
    2. But do not go too far.
    3. Otherwise audience will be bored.
- Look, seven rows exactly!
